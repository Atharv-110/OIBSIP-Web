          Elon Musk is the charismatic co-founder and CEO of electric car maker
          Tesla and rocket manufacturer SpaceX. Born and raised in South Africa,
          Musk spent time in Canada before finally moving to the U.S. Educated
          at the University of Pennsylvania in physics, Musk started getting his
          feet wet as a serial tech entrepreneur with early successes like Zip2
          and X.com. He was instrumental in creating the company that became
          PayPal. Musk has behaved in eccentric ways from time to time and has
          identified himself as having Asperger's syndrome.
